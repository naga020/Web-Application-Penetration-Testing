# Web Application Penetration Testing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Web Application Penetration Testing** using **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** in a controlled lab environment.  
The aim is to identify, exploit, and document common web vulnerabilities with proper proof of exploitation.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Environment
- **Operating System:** Kali Linux
- **Vulnerable Application:** DVWA
- **Web Browser:** Firefox
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 🔍 Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1️⃣ SQL Injection
- **Category:** Injection
- **Affected Module:** DVWA – SQL Injection
- **Description:**  
  The application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing attackers to manipulate SQL queries and retrieve unauthorized data.
- **Proof of Exploitation:**  
  Screenshot showing successful SQL Injection is available in the `screenshots/` directory.

---

### 2️⃣ Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Category:** XSS
- **Affected Module:** DVWA – Stored XSS
- **Description:**  
  Malicious scripts are permanently stored on the server and executed when other users view the affected page.

---

### 3️⃣ Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Category:** XSS
- **Affected Module:** DVWA – Reflected XSS
- **Description:**  
  User-supplied input is reflected directly in the server response without proper validation, leading to script execution.

## 🧪 Proof of Exploitation
Each vulnerability is supported with **proof-of-concept screenshots** demonstrating:
- Payload execution
- Application response
- Evidence of vulnerability exploitation

All screenshots are stored in the `screenshots/` directory.

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities
- Hands-on experience with **manual web application testing**
- Documentation of vulnerabilities using **industry-standard formats**
- Version control and project management using **GitHub**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project was conducted **strictly for educational purposes** on intentionally vulnerable applications.  
Any attempt to perform similar attacks on real-world applications without permission is illegal.
